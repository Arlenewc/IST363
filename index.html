            <p>Hurricane Irma pounded the Bahamas before making landfall Friday night in the northern part 
                of Cuba as it cycled toward Florida. It is expected to hit there late Saturday with wind speeds 
                powerful enough to snap trees and power poles and tear the roofs off buildings. And Gov. Rick 
                Scott said the lower half of Florida could face life threatening storm surge as early as Saturday morning.

            <p>Irma, which made landfall on the Camagüey Archipelago of Cuba as a Category 5 hurricane with 160-mile-per-hour
                 winds, had already caused flooding in Cuba’s northeast on Friday as it continued to move along the nation’s 
                 northern coastline, according to the National Hurricane Center.
